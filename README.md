# Measuregraph-Fabric-Flow-Optimization

The report outlines a project analyzing the measuregraph inspection process at a fabric dyeing and finishing facility serving the apparel industry. The team identified that the facility lacked visibility on the time fabrics spent in the queue between inspection and the measuregraph station, resulting in significant rework profits being lost. By utilizing a Fishbone diagram, they pinpointed key causes of inefficiencies, such as outdated communication and inventory management issues. The project involved gathering and analyzing data on fabric defects and queuing times through various tools, including Excel and Tableau, to create a comprehensive dashboard. This dashboard is designed to help the facility visualize defects, identify queuing delays, and optimize their measuregraph utilization, ultimately aiming to improve profits by enhancing the decision-making process. The report emphasizes the potential for future improvements in data collection and process tracking, which could lead to better operational efficiency across the facility.
